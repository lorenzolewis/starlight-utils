:::caution

This package is still in alpha. There are known issues with accessibility that have not been addressed. If any issues are found please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lorenzolewis/starlight-multi-sidebar/issues).

:::

There are cases where having multiple sidebars for a Starlight site can be useful. [Starlight does not currently support this natively](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/959), but this Starlight plugin gives a minimal implementation of this.

:::tip

Take a look at the sidebar on this page to see what this looks like!
